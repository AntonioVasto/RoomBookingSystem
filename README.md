<h1>Booking System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
My Mathematics teacher in my school faced a persistent problem with classroom bookings. He struggled to determine which classrooms were already in use, and for how long they would remain occupied. As a result, he would wander around the school, wasting precious time trying to locate an available classroom. This issue led to frustration for both the teacher and students, as they were frequently interrupted by others who were searching for a place to study. Consequently, school efficiency suffered. TO address this problem, I approached the teacher with a solution â€“ a program that would enable teachers and students to book classrooms in advance.
